# Good-Morning-Automated-Facebook-Messenger
Do you want to send a good morning message to your loved ones on Facebook? Are you too lazy to do that? Here's the solution for you. 

# Prerequisites
I made this a long time ago, so I may be missing a few things. You need __node__ and I believe __npm__

<br /> 
<br />

This script can be automated with cron or a windows equivalent of cron. 

<br /> 
<br />

# Running the program
You must edit __Good_Morning.js__ and input your Facebook credentials (line 4 and 5) and the Facebook ID of the person that you want to message (line 35). Then, run ```node Good_Morning.js```
